=============================================================

          WAIFor's Trigger Effects and Modding Patch
                      For UserPatch 1.4
                    Beta Version 1.00.1.0000

                      By WAIFor, 2016

=============================================================

This is a launcher that provides several pretty effects for your Age of Empires: 
The Conquerors. You need only edit the ini file "wtep.ini" to set target exe, 
then run "wtep.exe", you'll get some amazing new effects!
Besides, you can use this for modding. You can set modding settings in ini file.
Currently there are only one modding patch, making every building has page button.

Please use newest UserPatch 1.4 RC core file. The size of main exe file should be 
3,072 KB. Daniel Pereira's Trigger Patch 1.5 is okay, too.
Before first run for one exe, this launcher would change size of the exe file,
as well as allocations, making pathces able to place in.
You can also install patches into exe file permanently instead of injecting, by
modifying ini contents.


----------------------------------------
  Trigger Effects
----------------------------------------

- To activate WAIFor's trigger effects, please set General->triggers as 1.

- All offical effects were attached with "number" inputs. Some certain effects
  have extra inputs, like Kill Object, also has "quantity" box now.
  
- New effects by setting different "number"s:

    [Task Object]
    1 - Teleport source units to destination point OR UNIT.
   *6 - Change ids of source units to id of the destination unit.
   *7 - Change source units into the destination unit. You can use this beyond 
        civilization restrictions (e.g. change human player's units into deers).
 **#8 - Change sounds of protounits of source units as the destination's. This 
        means that you can create female units or speakable ships. The "protounits"
        is what the player's standard unit like, so once sound changed, all new 
        units created of this player after changed as well.
 **#9 - Change graphics of protounits of source units as the destination's. The
        graphics include standing, walking, dying and attacking graphics. If you
        choose eye candies as dest, their graphics of all 4 actions might become 
        all the same. If you set a farm as the dest, protounits would be invisible 
        at all.
	NOTE: except 6 and 8, all other effects would not do immediately in visual, 
	    units must do some action after to update their appearance.
        
    [Kill Object]
    1 - Make source units undead, bringing'em infinite HP instantly.
   *2 - Make ids source units into positive or negative ones. Units with negative
        ids are unable to control, even with triggers (kill or remove are available).
        If you set "quantity" as 0, ids of units would be negative, else positive.
   #3 - Change how source protounits display on minimap. Quantity determines the
        result. 0 makes protounits invisible on minimap, 1 makes them visible as 
        squares, while 2 changes marks into smaller diamonds.
   #4 - Change source protounits visibility in fog. Quantity determines the result.
        0 makes protounits invisible in fog, 1 contributes visible, and 3 could make
        protounits throughly invisible in scene.
    7 - Set current angles of source units as the quantity shows. 0 stands for
        east, 1 rotates one delta clockwise and so on.
   #8 - Set icon ids of source protounits as the quantity shows.
   #9 - Set death unit ids of source protounits as the quantity shows.

    [Move Sight]
    2 - Move sight to source unit.
    3 - Cut sight to source unit.
    
    [Tribute]
   #7 - Let the DESTINATION player get or lose line of sight of the player set by
        quantity. Quantity 0 stands for gaia, 1 to 8 the others. To make the dest 
        player lose LoS, please plus 100 to the quantity - 100, 101, 102 ... If 
        you lose LoS of yourself, you'll see buildings of yours standing in black
        area.
   #8 - Let the DESTINATION player get or lose fields explored by the player set by
        quantity.
    9 - Set civilization of dest player as the quantity stands. 0 is gaia, 1 is 
        British, 2 is French, etc. This would only change civ name and sounds of 
        units, does not affect tech tree. But, this effect would change tech tree
        after loading saved games!
        
    * These effects are unstable, they probably cause crashes, especially in returning 
      to the map editor.
   ** They are not robust, you must confirm the destination player, or bug splats.
    # Effects would be restored after save and load, so you need to create loops to
      keep them affected.
    
- In "Display Instructions", you can set 65536 types of color set for text. To do 
  this, please add prefix "<????>". The four characters represent various colors.
  Each character can be CAPTIAL A to P, AA to PP are colors #0 to #255 on palette
  50500. The former 2 are for text color, while the latter 2 outline color. For
  example, "<EDIH>" makes gold text and white outline. Specially, AB stands for
  transparent color.
  
- Removed prohibition of projectile as source units in "Task Object". You can 
  control projectiles' action now, even replace their graphics by man! Don't worry 
  about moving projectiles shot by others unwillingly, because they're of negative 
  ids!


----------------------------------------
  Modding
----------------------------------------

- To activate Modding functions, please set General->Modding as 1.

- Functions could be set in the ini file. Generally, set values to 0 makes mapped 
  functions disabled.

- At present, there is only one modding function - attaching all buildings with 
  "Next Page" button. Value of "SecondPage" set as 2 would enable this.


----------------------------------------
  Install Into EXE
----------------------------------------

- Set General->Install larger than 0, and the launcher would try to put patches
  into the exe file. After that, you can play by run game directly!
- Please do backup before install.
