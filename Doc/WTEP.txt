=============================================================

     WAIFor's Trigger & Extension Patch For UserPatch 1.4
                      For UserPatch 1.4
                     Version 1.02.03.0430

                     By WAIFor, 2016-2017

=============================================================

This is a launcher that provides several pretty effects for your Age of Empires: 
The Conquerors. You need only edit the ini file "wtep.ini" to set target exe, 
then run "wtep.exe", you'll get some amazing new effects!
Besides, you can use this for modding. You can set modding settings in ini file.
Currently there are only one modding patch, making every building has page button.

Please use newest UserPatch 1.4 RC core file. The size of main exe file should be 
3,072 KB. Daniel Pereira's Trigger Patch 1.5 is okay, too.
Before first run for one exe, this launcher would change size of the exe file,
as well as allocations, making pathces able to place in.
You can also install patches into exe file permanently instead of injecting, by
modifying ini contents.

You can set config ini file by command line arguments. For example, run
"wtep setting.ini" means to use setting.ini as config file, instead of wtep.ini



----------------------------------------
  Trigger Effects
----------------------------------------


- To activate WAIFor's trigger effects, please set General->triggers as 1. Then
  you need to set some values in section Effects.


- Key and values in section Effects:

    [CasualTerrain=]
    Activation of this item would make terrain editing more casually - creating 
    waters without generating shores, or on ridged base. Beaches would not be
    replaced while painting neighborhood.
    Besides, it could affect generations of random map. So it is recommended that
    you activate this in the launcher instead of changing EXE.

    [ImprovedEditor=]
    In order to enable some improvement of editor, please set this as 1 .

    [MoreResources=]
    Activate more resources in trigger's tribute list, like berseker's healing
    rate, building rate, etc. You can also set language dlls in section
    "NewResourceLanguages".
    
    [NewEffects=]
    0 means no new effects, 1 is to enable them. 2 is to be compatible with Daniel
    Pereira's ETP 1.5 - so that you can type 5 characters in "Number" box.

    [SiegeWeaponBugFix=]
    If enabled, when siege weapons have their owner/name/HP... changed by triggers,
    researches will no longer restore them.

    [TaskProjectiles=]
    This item can enable "Task Object" to order projectiles when set as 1. You
    can control projectiles' action now. Don't worry about moving projectiles
    shot by others unwillingly, because they're of negative ids!
    However, we don't recommand you to use this function, you can use Petrol instead.


- New effects:

  - All Effects have new "Number" input boxes now. Some certain effects have extra
    inputs, like Kill Object, also has "quantity" box now.

  - In "Display Instructions", you can set 65536 types of color set for text. To do 
    this, please add prefix "<????>". The four characters represent various colors.
    Each character can be CAPTIAL A to P, AA to PP are colors #0 to #255 on palette
    50500. The former 2 are for text color, while the latter 2 outline color. For
    example, "<EDIH>" makes gold text and white outline. Specially, AB stands for
    transparent color.

  - New branch effects added in original ones.


- Improvement of Editor

  - You can type negative symbol "-" instantly in Quantity now.

  - In trigger editor, on choosing buildings, units without language DLL ids would
    shown as blank items, making user hard to distinguish'em. Now, those problems is
    solved, they will use interior names.

  - Player's civilization could set as GAIA (called "Random").

  - Rotating any buildings, not only Houses.


- Custom Resource Names

  - You can set lang DLLs of those resources in [NewResourceLanguages]:
    PopLimit - Population limitation
    BuildRate - Build rate
    MarketRate - Market trading rate
    CurrentAge - Current rate
    MonkHealRate - Monk's healing rate
    BerserkerHealRate - Berserker's self-healing rate
    FaithRecharge - Monk's faith recharging rate
    RelicProduction - Relic's production rate
    MonkHealRange - Monk's healing range (Called "Archbishop" in default)
    FoodProduction - Food Gather Production
    WoodProduction - Wood Gather Production
    GoldProduction - Gold Gather Production
    StoneProduction - Stone Gather Production
    TradeProduction - Trading Production

  
- New effects by setting different "number"s:

    [Change Diplomacy]
   #1 - Let the source player get or lose revealed field of destination player. Ally
        makes player obtains, the other loses.
   #2 - Let the source player get or lose line of sight of destination player. If you
        lose LoS of yourself, you'll see buildings of yours standing in black area.
    3 - Let the source CLIENT control destination player. After that, source client
        will see destination's interface, scene, and do their's orders. Client N is
        once game started, the client controlling player N.

    [Send Chat]
    1 - Use cheat by Dest Player.

    [Tribute]
    1 - Directly set destination player's resource quantity.
    2 - Multiply with quantity, from source to dest in confirmed resource.
    3 - If positive, set destination's quantity confirmed resource (0-Food, 1-Wood,
        2-Stone, etc.) as source's list confirmed resource. Else, effect will plus
        rather than set (-1-Food, -2-Wood, -3-Stone, etc.).
    4 - Multiply destination's quantity confirmed resource by source's list
        confirmed resource. Negative quantity makes multiply and plus.
    5 - Divide destination's quantity confirmed resource by source's list
        confirmed resource. Negative quantity makes divide and plus.
    8 - Tribute to Destination Player randomly. For example, if Quanaity is 5, the
        actual tribute would be between 0 and 4.
    9 - Set quantity of resource of Destination Player randomly.
   10 - Tribute from source to dest, but multiplied with 0.001.
   11 - Directly set destination player's resource quantity multiplied with 0.001.
   12 - Multiply with quantity permillages, from source to dest in confirmed resource.

    [Create Object]
    3 - Now, there is a zone selector, choosed zone would replace target point in play 
        time, creating units in every cell without restriction. However, you must
        confirm the target point as well, or the effect would be unavailable.
    4 - Create unit at the point located by player's food and wood. It has no
        restriction too.

    [Task Object]
    1 - Teleport source units to destination point OR UNIT.
    2 - Garrison source units into destination unit.
    3 - Move units to the point located by player's food and wood.
        
    [Kill Object]
    10~99 - Change units' properties. 10 to 39 would set, 40 to 69 add, 70 to 99 set
        by specified resource storage.
        Those properties includes:
        10 - Unit Id
        11 - Grpahic Angle
        12 - Resource Quantity (f)
        13 - Projectile Quantity (f)
        14 - Resource Type
        15 - Selection Effect
        * (f) means that the property is float, so quantity or resource would be divided
          by 1000.
    100~999 - Change units' attributes. 100 to 399 would set, 400 to 699 add, 700 to
        999 set by specified resource storage.
        Those are protounit attributes. If one unit was not isolated (changed owner, name,
        max hp or else, would not be affected by techs), its protounit was in player's tech
        tree. But isolated units had their own protos. So, please be sure what kind of changes
        do you want. If you want to isolate units without any modification, you can use
        "Change Unit Hitpoint" trigger with 0 quantity.
        The attributes table is too large to show below, so it is listed at the end.
    1100~1999 - Change protounits' attributes. Like the above one, but protounits are from
        player's tech tree. In the other word, the unit may be not present.

    [Remove Object]
    1 - Transform source units into units set by "Quantity". Only Type 70+ units can do this.
        It is best to transform into same Type units.

    [Move Sight]
    2 - Move sight to source unit. You have to set a target point to make the effect
        available.
    3 - Cut sight to source unit.

    [Damage Unit]
    1 - Set source units' current HP.
    2 - Damage source units by their max HP's permillage. e.g. 100 is damage their
        10% of maximum hitpoints.
    3 - Set source units' current HP by their max HP's permillage.
    4 - Damage source units by their lost HP's permillage.
    5 - Set source units' current HP by their current HP's permillage.
    6 - Save HP into Resource. You can save units' average HPs into certain resource.
    7 - Load HP from Resource.
    NOTE: effect "Change Object HP" (with Number = 2) would trim overflowed HPs.

    * These effects are unstable, they probably cause crashes, especially in returning 
      to the map editor.
   ** They are not robust, you must confirm the destination player, or bug splats.
    # Effects would be restored after save and load, so you need to create loops to
      keep them affected.

    1 - In train page, one unit of Type 80 would be set as foundation button, if conditions
        below satisfied:
        - The unit is not class 51 (Packed Siege Unit).
        - The unit's Train Time is less than 0.

    [DepositButton=]

    [FunctionGarrison=]
    0 - None.
    1 - Activate "Functional Garrison". If one unit is vacant, it could change itself into
        specified unit when engaged. Besides, one unit can transform after the last passenger
        leaves.
        Ability 160 would set enter transform arguments. There can be multi abilities in
        one unit. "Resource In" determines the transform unit id, and both "Unit Id" and 
        "Class" filter what passenger units can be.

        1st - Unit Id = passenger id
        2nd - Unit Id = -1, Class = passenger class

        monk's unit ids, so that they would restore after deposit, instead of becoming
        normal monks.

        would take ability graphics as new grpahics: proceeding as standing, carrying
        as standing, and action as dying.
        * "Tool Graphic" is not used, because it can set graphic of monk's walking to 
          relics.

    [MoreGarrisonTypes=]
    0 - None.
    1 - New Garrision Type bits:
        5th - Animals (9, 10, 29, 58)
        6th - Vehicles (13, 54, 51, 55)
        7th - Boats (2, 20, 21, 22, 53)
        8th - Custom
        Those units can garrision into buildings via Garrision Button, or by alt+right-click.
        But, at present, animals has no ability to garrision.
        Custom classes could be set in section [CustomGarrisiontypes]. Key ranges from
        1 to 60.
        You can also set specific classes to garrison by custom types. Using "ClassX=",
        X is from 0 to 59. The value could be 0 to 8, 0 is no garrison type.
        Here's an example:
        [CustomGarrisionTypes]
        1=0 ; Archer
        2=6 ; Infantry
        class13=1; Siege Weapons with 1st type
        class4=1; Villagers cannot garrison
    2 - Like 1, but another function added. In ability "Garrison Class #3" (required to 
        garrison in buildings), you can set an override class for garrison, by setting
        "Resource In" as a positive figure. For example, a cavalry can garrison like a archer
        when his garrison ability "Resource In" equals 0.

    [NewSkills=]
    0 - None
    1 - Add new skills and skill buttons. Most skill buttons were placed at 15th, but
        for buildings with second page enabled, they would be at 14th. "Tower Mode / Break
        off Combat" in Advanced Genie Editor determines unit's skill:
        0 - None
        1 - Spawn. Object can spawn units confirmed by "Attribute Piece" (the same below)
            This attribute determines id of child unit. A positive value make units spawn
            own unit, negative for GAIA.
        2 - Transform. Units transforms into confirmed units. Multi-ordered.
        3 - Train Page. The button opens building's train page. It will be the second page
            first, but you can enable SecondPage to turn into first.
        4 - Heal. Units can heal other friend units when they have heal ability.
        5 - Building Page. Like villager's building page, Attribute Piece stands for the
            Train Location Id.
        6 - Pack. Just like trebuchets. Only Type 80 can use this, and confirmed by
            "Transform Unit".
        7 - Unpack. Like 6, but unit changed before progress.
        8 - Attack Ground.
        9 - Pack 2. Different with 6, it is placed at 15th corner, in order to overlay
            arrow button.
       10 - Unpack 2.
       11 - Single Build. One can build the only building.
       13 - Unload. Just like Transport Boat, however, for a different class unit, it can
            only unloads directly, instead of move and unload. You need to have Unit
            Attribute 1 set.
       14 - Teleport. Units can teleport into destination point, then leave an comfirmed
            unit at original point. Restriction applied.
       15 - Paradrop. Unit can drop a confirmed unit at destination point. No restriction.
       16 - Train Page With Market. Like 3, but there are also trade buttons. Attribute
            Piece BITS determines what trade can do:
            0-Sell Wood, 1-Sell Food, 2-Sell Stone, 3-Buy Wood, 4-Buy Food, 5-Buy Stone.
            A building with this skill doesn't show skill button, but trade buttons.
       17 - Convert. Currently this is not available.
       18 - Scout. Explore the destination area.
       19 - Get out. Get all passengers out.

    [RandomTrain=]
    0 - None.
    1 - Enable "Random Train". When one unit was trained, it would be probably changed 
        into some other units.
        To do so, use unit ability #164. "Unit" as another unit, "Resource In" as probablity,
        ranging from 0 to 100. You can also set multi abilities, making more possibilities.

    [Regeneration=]
    0 - None.
    1 - Use "Regeneration" ability (#150) as a self-recover ability.
        "Work Rate Multiplier" determines healing rate - quantity every time. A negative
        value would decrease unit's HP.
        "Extra Range" determines max healing/min decreasing value. If HP is greater than
        that, stop recovering; less, stop decreasing.
        "Unknown 1" determines mode: 0 is once per second, 1 is 100 times per second.
        "Resource In" can be set as a resource multiplier. Negative quantity would stop 
        changing.

    [VillagerThirdPage=]
    0 - Only two pages in villager building page.
    1 - The third page is attached. It lay in the next page of military buildings page.
        Buildings with Train Location between 21~35 would present here, regardless of
        Command ID. 

    [VisbilityInEditor=]
    0 - A unit with attr "Fog Visbility" be 3 would be invisible all the time.

    Set research id of Xth "do research". The research would be achieved after
    cheat sent.

  New Terrains
----------------------------------------


- As we know, there can be 42 terrains at most in AOKTC. New terrains created
  by AGE would crash. So we provided a solution to this problem. By this, we
  can append extra 52 terrains, 94 in total.
  But, those new terrains can not be created by AGE. To do this, you need to
  deflate DAT first, then modify data after 42 terrains, making it new terrains.
  Finally inflate again.


- If you understand, you can set General->terrains as 1, then arguments below
  in [NewTerrains]:

    [X=] (X ranged from 42 to 93)
    Language DLL ids of new terrains. Those would be shown in Scenario Editor.
    You should set them serially, because the list would be cut off at zero 
    language id.

    [MaxExtraTerrains=]
    Set maximum of extra terrains, default is 52. You don't have to set this,
    in fact. However, setting a appropriate number is more safe if your DAT is
    in chaos.



----------------------------------------
  Install Into EXE
----------------------------------------

- Set General->Install larger than 0, and the launcher would try to put patches
  into the exe file. After that, you can play by run game directly!


- PLEASE DO BACKUP BEFORE INSTALL!

  Special Thanks To
----------------------------------------


- Hawk AOC (www.hawkaoc.net). I met The Conquerors Expansion here, as well as UserPatch.
  Also, members supported me much for this project.

- UserPatch Group. I won't catch the idea of making branch effects by "Number" without
  the UP patch. And the patch provided us easier ways in modification of the EXE file.

- Daniel Pereira, the author of Portuguese Civ Mod and Trigger Patch 1.5. His PCM inspired
  me to modify assemble codes in EXE files, and I referred much from his source codes.

- JustTesting1234, provider of patch of villager's third building page.

- You can visit my GitHub to seek source code: https://github.com/ImWG/WTEP
